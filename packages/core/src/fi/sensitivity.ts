// sensitivity.ts — the one-way FI tornado (ASMP-02 / D-12/D-13/D-14, L6), the "no headline number
// without a range" instrument. For each of the SIX drivers (return, inflation, appreciation,
// maintenance, tax, swr) it perturbs ONE stored band from the V3 `sensitivity` slice and re-runs the
// SAME pure FI projection (`fiImpact(...).buy`) — Pitfall 10's "sensitivity must be a cheap re-run".
//
// NO BESPOKE PER-DRIVER MATH (Pitfall 10): the only per-driver difference is WHICH assumption key is
// perturbed and the absolute-vs-relative mode. There is no `switch(driver)` with distinct projection
// math per arm — every arm calls the SAME `fiImpact` on a perturbed `EngineInput`.
//
// BAND SEMANTICS (D-12 / L6): FIVE drivers perturb their rate ABSOLUTELY (`rate ± band` in Dec). The
// SIXTH — `tax` — is the ONLY RELATIVE band (L6): it scales the property-tax rate multiplicatively by
// `× (1 − taxBandRelative)` / `× (1 + taxBandRelative)`. Each driver declares its mode explicitly in
// the DRIVER_SPECS table, so the perturbation is unambiguous and data-driven.
//
// RANKING (D-14): `swingMonths = |highMonth − lowMonth|`, where each endpoint's month is its
// `reached` month OR — when `unreached` — its `cappedAtMonth` bound. This makes an unreached endpoint
// contribute a MAX-magnitude swing measured against the horizon cap, with NO `Infinity` ever
// materialized (L3 — `canonicalJson` throws on non-finite; the discriminated `FiOutcome` never
// becomes a sentinel). Rows are sorted DESCENDING by `swingMonths`; `topDrivers` = the top 3.
//
// DETERMINISM (D-13): bands come from `input.assumptions.sensitivity` (V3 stored data), never
// hardcoded; every perturbation re-freezes through `engineInput` (re-validating the perturbed band at
// the Zod boundary, T-04-13) so a non-canonical value is rejected, not computed. All perturbation
// arithmetic is in the frozen `Dec` clone; `Dec` is not re-exported.
