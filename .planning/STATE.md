# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-22)

**Core value:** Answer "what does buying this house do to our early-retirement timeline?" — and be allowed to conclude "don't buy / rent and invest the difference."

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Foundation]: Pure framework-agnostic calc core (no React); enforced by package boundary + lint rule
- [Foundation]: Decimal-precise money representation, never raw float dollars
- [Foundation]: Assumptions are first-class versioned stored data; scenarios snapshot a frozen copy for reproducibility
- [FI]: Re-implement FI math clean, reconcile against existing retirement model via golden-master oracle test
- [FI]: Long-horizon SWR default (~3-3.5%), not 4% — configurable assumption
- [Phase ?]: [Foundation]: CORE-01 enforced by eslint-plugin-boundaries deny-by-default (allow only decimal.js+zod) + no-DOM/no-JSX core tsconfig
- [Phase ?]: [Foundation]: Negative fixtures (react import + DOM global) committed as durable proof the lint/tsc guards fail the build; boundary.test.ts asserts it portably via execSync
- [Phase 01-02]: [Foundation]: Single frozen Dec = Decimal.clone({ precision: 34, rounding: ROUND_HALF_EVEN }); global Decimal never .set() (D-14). Banker's rounding demonstrably required (HALF_UP breaks the cent tests)
- [Phase 01-02]: [Foundation]: Money is immutable + branded with a closed string-only API and no number-returning valueOf/toJSON; rounds to cents only at toCents (D-01/D-02/D-03)
- [Phase 01-02]: [Foundation]: Type-level guarantees (no bare-number money math, CalendarDate brand) enforced via *.type-test.ts in the tsc -b graph (esbuild/Vitest do not honor @ts-expect-error)
- [Phase 01-02]: [Foundation]: Determinism runtime guard (Date.now/Math.random throw) wired into the core Vitest setupFiles (D-12 runtime half); CalendarDate is a pure branded YYYY-MM-DD string, no JS Date (D-13)
- [Phase 01-03]: [Foundation]: AssumptionSet is nested by domain + versioned by integer schemaVersion via a Zod discriminatedUnion; unknown versions rejected at parse (D-04/D-05, ASMP-01)
- [Phase 01-03]: [Foundation]: Numeric tunables serialize as canonical decimal STRINGS (decStr regex, not z.number()); floats can never re-enter the boundary (D-06)
- [Phase 01-03]: [Foundation]: EngineInput is the single immutable snapshot unit threading asOf (CalendarDate) + assumptions explicitly, Object.freeze'd, never derived from Date.now (D-11)
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01-04]: [Foundation]: Reproducibility loop closed (PROF-04) — runCanary does real (1+r)^30 Dec compounding reading an AssumptionSet slice; canonicalJson serializes Money as decimal strings with sorted keys; golden master deep-equal compared, regenerated ONLY behind UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 (not toMatchSnapshot)
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 01-04]: [Foundation]: Public @house/core barrel finalized as the stable downstream import boundary; raw Dec/Decimal no longer exported (dollars cross only as the closed Money API)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Critical correctness pitfalls (float money, amortization final-balance, PMI 78/80 basis, DTI definitions, real-vs-nominal FI, opportunity-cost symmetry, SWR horizon) are existential — fence each into its mapped phase with gating verification (see research/PITFALLS.md).
- Anti-funnel guarantee: a realistic input set must reach a "rent and invest" verdict (acceptance check in Phase 4).
