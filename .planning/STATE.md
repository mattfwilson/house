# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-22)

**Core value:** Answer "what does buying this house do to our early-retirement timeline?" — and be allowed to conclude "don't buy / rent and invest the difference."
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundations-determinism-core

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundations-determinism-core) — EXECUTING

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Foundation]: Pure framework-agnostic calc core (no React); enforced by package boundary + lint rule
- [Foundation]: Decimal-precise money representation, never raw float dollars
- [Foundation]: Assumptions are first-class versioned stored data; scenarios snapshot a frozen copy for reproducibility
- [FI]: Re-implement FI math clean, reconcile against existing retirement model via golden-master oracle test
- [FI]: Long-horizon SWR default (~3-3.5%), not 4% — configurable assumption
- [Phase ?]: [Foundation]: CORE-01 enforced by eslint-plugin-boundaries deny-by-default (allow only decimal.js+zod) + no-DOM/no-JSX core tsconfig
- [Phase ?]: [Foundation]: Negative fixtures (react import + DOM global) committed as durable proof the lint/tsc guards fail the build; boundary.test.ts asserts it portably via execSync

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Critical correctness pitfalls (float money, amortization final-balance, PMI 78/80 basis, DTI definitions, real-vs-nominal FI, opportunity-cost symmetry, SWR horizon) are existential — fence each into its mapped phase with gating verification (see research/PITFALLS.md).
- Anti-funnel guarantee: a realistic input set must reach a "rent and invest" verdict (acceptance check in Phase 4).
